* Confidence Level: Low

**KEY SYMPTOMS OBSERVED:**
* Unable to clearly identify symptoms from the provided image

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:**
* Image quality or clarity insufficient for accurate diagnosis
* Consider checking the following common issues manually:

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Take clearer, well-lit photos from multiple angles
2. Test water parameters (pH, ammonia, nitrites, nitrates)
3. Check for these common fish health indicators:
   - Unusual swimming patterns
   - Changes in color or appearance
   - Reduced appetite
   - Visible spots, growths, or abnormalities
4. Check for these common plant health indicators:
   - Leaf discoloration or spotting
   - Wilting despite adequate water
   - Unusual growth patterns
   - Root condition (should be white and firm)
